Player "One cup of milk tea won't ever kill me!!" playSound(CorrectAnswer)

"Thank you so much! I will drink this later!"

Putra "Glad you like it! It's good to consume sweet things when you want to booze your spirit, you know?" setExpression(default)

Player "Hahaha, I feel the same! I actually have a sweet tooth. I can eat one bag of chocolate in a minute if my Mom didn't stop me."

"But I won't do it anymore starts from now on, though."

Putra "Whoaa, that's amazing! You really had a big appetite toward sweet things, don't ya?" setExpression(surprised)

Player "U-uh... Is it that bad..?"

Putra "Nah, it's the opposite! Let's have a battle someday! We will see who's faster to eat that chocolate!" setExpression(smiling)

Player "Hahaha, sure! Just call me when you're ready!"

"What did just happen? I'm actually making a conversation with Putra!" disableChar(Putra)

"Is this actually happen because I started to increase my fitness and dieting? Did it really give me some effect?"

"But... It would be bad if Putra really challenge me to eat that much chocolate.... The effects will be gone surely!"

"Uh-oh.... Let's hope he will forget that challenge...."

Narrator "You feel happy!!!" setStatus(happiness[5])
