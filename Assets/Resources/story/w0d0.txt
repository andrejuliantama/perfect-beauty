Student 1 "Hey, did you heard about that pretty student in class C?"

Student 2 "Oh! Do you mean, Sisca? That girl who looks like a model? I bet every guy in this school had a crush on her."

Student 1 "Yeah! The one that has slender body and beautiful face!"

"Ahh... It must be nice to have everyone eyes on you. But thank God she's not our classmate! I would feel insecure everytime if I had to look at her everyday!"

Student 2 "Ah! You’re right! Thank goodness most of girls in our class looks ordinary and not that attractive!"

Mila "What do you mean?" setExpression(annoyed) disableChar(Satya)

Satya "Being pretty, popular, and stuff… Does it really bother you all?" setExpression(annoyed) disableChar(Mila)

Mila "I mean… To begin with, things like being popular and pretty already like a different world for us…" setExpression(annoyed) disableChar(Satya)

"We don’t even try to imagine being a popular girl in school… Right, Player?" setExpression(annoyed)

Player "Well… Um, yeah…"

Mila "And how about you, Satya? Did you also see Sisca in the way like how they said it earlier?" setExpression(annoyed)

Satya "I mean, she is indeed pretty. But other than that, I don’t really know her character, so… that’s it. I’m not that interested." setExpression(thinking) disableChar(Mila)

Player "I guess we can’t compare Satya to one of that guys."

Satya "Hey, what do you mean! Don’t tell me you really did feel jealous about her?"	setExpression(annoyed)

"You can’t compare yourself to her, you know. Both of you are totally different."

Player "…. Well, I only think that it must be nice to be pretty and treated in such a good way…"

Mila "Do you mean all this time you’ve been treated badly?" setExpression(thinking) disableChar(Satya)

Player "No, no! I just-…"

"Actually It kinda pissed me off when they said things about us being ordinary and stuff…"

Mila "Hey Player, are you okay? Did something happen?" setExpression(thinking)

"Mila, and I are a classmate, and Satya is from a different class. But he often play to our class just like before."

"Our school have about twelve class for each grade. Because of that, they're many students from different classes who don't know each other yet."

"But of course this statement doesn't apply to that popular students. Without even trying, they already has everyone eyes on them."

Mila "Player, Have you ever seen this ‘Sisca’ before?" setExpression(default)
